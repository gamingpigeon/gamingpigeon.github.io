        <p class="dark">Have you noticed that America’s favorite group dance after the Electric Slide to The Dougie has more or less disappeared from the wedding reception’s dance floor? The chicken dance’s armpit flapping and fingering yapping were as American as saluting and doing the wave. How could it possibly disappear from DJ’s playlists, where has our patriotism gone? What the cluck?</p>
       <p>For 2.47 minutes of glorious “dunin nanana dunin nanana,” children to grandmas, horny groomsmen to likewise priests would jump and twist, then do-si-do as if they were happiest of American southerners at a Bavarian festival.  Sadly today, the incessant music has stopped. What once inspired droves of drunken wedding guest or children high on wedding cake to the center of the room has been removed from one of our greatest lifetime celebrations. In the words of Don McLean has “The day the music died,” already come and gone and taken the chicken dance with it?</p>
